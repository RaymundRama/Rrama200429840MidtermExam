---- 6 November 2022 ----
I accidentally made a commit to this repository while trying to set up my ICE 7 project. 
If this should be a problem, and I am required to explain myself, please contact me at: 200429840@student.georgianc.on.ca

I currently do not know of a clear way to remove this commit without risking the deletion of other code. For now I believe the commit should stay so that I don't run the risk of ruining the reset of the repository.
